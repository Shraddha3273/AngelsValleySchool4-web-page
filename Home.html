<p2>This is one of Buddha's greatest messages to his deciples. To be one's 
own light is to be capable, ethical and self-assured;enabling one to steer towards
the truth and not fear the darkness. <br>  Our motto encapsulates our vision
and mission,that every person is a lifelong self learner, confident of the 
path they tread and a shining beacon guiding others to fulfillment.</p2>
